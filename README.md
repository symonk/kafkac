## 🐍 kafkac — A Structured Kafka Consumer Framework for Python

**kafkac** is a minimal, opinionated framework for building reliable Kafka consumers in Python using the [confluent-kafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) client.
It abstracts away the boilerplate of manual offset handling, shutdown coordination, and message deserialization - giving you a clean async interface for consuming messages safely and predictably.
